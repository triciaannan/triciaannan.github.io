I’m a Master’s graduate in Economics who loves working with large datasets to uncover meaningful insights, apply statistical methods, and create compelling data visualizations. I'm fluent in SQL, Python, R, and Tableau, and I enjoy turning complex data into clear, actionable stories.

And oh — I speak some French too!
